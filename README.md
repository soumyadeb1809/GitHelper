# GitHelper Scripts
Scripts to help fetch/push all git repositories in a directory.

Pre-requisites
- Git bash must be installed in your system

Steps to get started:
- Clone/download the repository
- Copy the scripts in any directory (D:/UI Development)
- Make sure to remove all un-necessary repositories in the folder where you have your git repositories checked out, to improve Fetch/Push times
- Add the path to the scripts in your System Path variable or Account Path variable
- Open command prompt/powershell and navigate to the folder where git repositories are checked out, type <b>fetch</b> for fetching all the repos or <b>push</b> to push all your changes to current active branch
