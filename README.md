# GitHelper Scripts
Scripts to help fetch/push all git repositories in a directory.

Steps to get started:
- Clone the repo
- Copy the scripts in the root directory of all the git repositories
- Make sure to remove all un-necessary repositories to improve Fetch/Push times
- Add the path to the scripts in your Path variable
- Open command prompt/powershell type <b>fetch</b> for fetching all the repos or <b>push</b> to push all your changes to current active branch
- Alternatively you can also start the scripts by double clicking them.
